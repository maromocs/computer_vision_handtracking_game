# Hand Tracking Project (Under development)

This project implements a hand-tracking system, aimed at understanding the basics of machine learning by exploring its application in computer vision. As my first solo project, it serves as both a testing ground and a deep dive into the foundational concepts of ML.

## Project Overview

The hand-tracking system is designed to:

- Detect and track hands in real-time.
- Identify and analyze hand gestures or positions.
- Serve as a simple demonstration of machine learning in action.

## Objectives

1. **Learn by Doing:** This project is my first attempt at working with ML concepts independently, allowing me to get hands-on experience.
2. **Understand ML Workflow:** From dataset preparation to model deployment, I aimed to explore every stage of the machine learning pipeline.
3. **Experimentation:** Test and refine my understanding of hand-tracking techniques, while gaining familiarity with libraries and tools.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Visualization of key points (landmarks) on the hand.
- Simple and efficient implementation to focus on learning rather than complexity.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV: For image processing and video feed handling.
  - MediaPipe: For hand-tracking models and landmark detection.
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VSCode

## How It Works

1. **Input Capture:** Video input is captured using a webcam.
2. **Hand Detection:** MediaPipe's pre-trained hand-tracking model processes the video frames.
3. **Landmark Visualization:** Key points of the detected hand(s) are visualized in real-time.
4. **Output:** Results are displayed on the screen.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience with computer vision libraries.
- Improved understanding of how machine learning models work.
- Developed confidence in tackling ML projects independently.

## Future Improvements

- Implement gesture recognition for specific hand signs.
- Optimize performance for better real-time results.
- Explore training custom models for hand tracking.

## Notes

This project is a personal milestone as it marks my first independent journey into machine learning. It has been a testing phase for me to better grasp the inner workings of ML systems and refine my skills.

## Contributions

As this project was focused on personal learning, contributions are not currently open. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
